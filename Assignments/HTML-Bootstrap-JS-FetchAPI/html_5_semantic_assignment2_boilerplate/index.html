                    Structuring Web Page Using HTML5
                </h2>
                HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting hypertext
                documents on the World Wide Web. It was the fifth and final major HTML version that is now a retired
                World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living
                Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a
                consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).HTML5 was first released
                in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in
                October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other
                new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by
                computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain
                backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML1
                and even the DOM Level 2 HTML itself.

                    Styling Web Page Using HTML5
                </h2>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling
                of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
                colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide
                more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
                pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
                complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve
                the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
